### CIS 700: Commonsense Reasoning
### by [Dan Roth](http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~danroth/)
#### Tuesday and Thursday, 1:30-3:00 PM, LOCATION


<br/>

### Course Description

Humans engage in reasoning – we have a store of commonsense knowledge that we can quickly access and reason with, to make sense of new situations and make inferences about the world around us. Automating natural language understanding requires models that are informed by commonsense knowledge and the ability to reason with it in both common and unexpected situations. The success of statistical and deep learning methods has supported significant advances in some aspects of AI, especially those that depend on learning standalone models from large amounts of annotated data. But our models still do not know that “get me a piece of cake” requires first getting utensils, then cutting the cake, and placing it on a plate, and that it typically takes just minutes (as opposed to “baking a cake"); and they don't know that NYC is always on the East Coast, while Paul Simon is sometimes there.

The goal of this class was to understand the literature – old and new – on commonsense: knowledge acquisition, representation and reasoning – especially in the context of natural language understanding.

You will read, present and discuss papers, and do two projects. A small one in the first third of the semester, and a large and open ended one in the rest of the semester.  

### Prerequisites

Machine Learning class; CIS 419/519/520 or equivalent. Knowledge of NLP is recommended but not mandatory.

### Grading and Expectations

There will be
* **Course Projects** (40%) - The project will be done in teams of sizes 2 or 3; teams will proposed projects and consult us. We will have milestones along define a few intermediate stages and results will be reported and presented at the end of each stage.

* **Reading assignments** - Mandatory readings and additional recommended readings will be assigned every week.

* **Critical Surveys** ( 6 + 6 + 6 + 12 = 30% ) - Four (4) times a semester you will write a short critical essay on one of the additional readings.

* **Presentations** ( 20% ) - Once or twice you will present a paper from the additional readings (30 minutes, focusing on the mathematical/technical details of the paper). The presentations will be prepared in groups, whenever possible, and a group of presentations will form a coherent tutorial, whenever possible (more on that later).

* **Class Participation** ( 10% )


There is no final exam.

#### Expectations

This is an advanced course. I view my role as guiding you through the material and helping you in your first steps as an researcher. I expect that your participation in class, reading assignments and presentations will reflect independence, mathematical rigor and critical thinking.
